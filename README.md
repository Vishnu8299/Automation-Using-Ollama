# 🤖 Automation Using Ollama

**Transform complex tasks into streamlined, automated processes with the power of Ollama. This repository provides the essential tools and scripts needed to get started.**

## ✨ Highlights

- **Utilizes Ollama**: Leverage the Ollama tool for seamless model management and task automation.
- **User-Friendly Scripts**: Pre-built Python and batch files for instant use.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Adaptable to various automation needs.

## 📂 What's Inside

- **`int.py`**: The Python script serving as the automation engine.
- **`run_int_script.bat`**: Batch file to simplify script execution.
- **`README.md`**: Comprehensive project documentation.

## 🚦 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Python** (3.8+)
- **Ollama** installed and configured ([installation guide](https://ollama.com/docs/installation))
- **Python packages** as required by `int.py`

### 2. Installation

**Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automation-using-ollama.git
cd automation-using-ollama
```

**Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(If `requirements.txt` is absent, add the libraries needed for your `int.py` script.)*

### 3. Run the Scripts

**Execute via Python**:
```bash
python int.py
```

**Run with the Batch File**:
```bash
run_int_script.bat
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

The **`int.py`** script is the core of this project, programmed to automate various tasks using the Ollama tool's capabilities. Whether you're looking to manage model interactions, handle data, or automate other tasks, this script serves as a flexible starting point.

The **`run_int_script.bat`** file is a utility that enables you to run the Python script with just one click, simplifying repeated execution.
